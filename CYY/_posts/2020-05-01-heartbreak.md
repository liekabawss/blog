It's really interesting how the heart works. Your mind can be completely
logical and realize that you're the one who hasn't moved on, and that there's no way that she's thinking about you nearly as much as she visits your thoughts. Yet your heart, that's shattered and broken after she left, won't allow itself to be mended. Every time you hear a song full of memories, every time you see an old picture, every time you notice a remnant of your relationship, your chest tightens. And it tightens. And it tightens.

At least, that's how it works for me.

I loved my ex more than anything, and I really thought that she would be the one. The one to end it all, the one that I would be happy with for the rest of my life. She never quite believed that I thought of her as the best, and to be fair, I didn't give her reason to at the beginning. I made a mistake that came to haunt me for the better part of 10 months, and I spent any moment I could to ameliorate the situation, to lessen the impact of my words. It was a purely innocent remark from my standpoint, and to me, it was just something I thought was more of a reassuring comment than anything. But to her, it was the start of a landslide of insecurities, of never feeling like she was enough. Granted, I didn't know that she was insecure in herself. But that doesn't excuse me from making her feel the way she did.

I made a noted effort from then on to compliment her a lot more explicitly, to the point where it might have seemed superfluous, but each and every single word that left my mouth was sincere and genuine. Yet, it always plagued her. No matter what I said now, it could not erase the words that had so deeply imprinted themselves in her thoughts. We would fight incessantly and it tore us apart. I was willing to do anything to fix the problem, but she couldn't. Her prejudices against third party help meant she wouldn't seek it, and being desperate to save our relationship and to stay with the person I loved so very much, I pressured her often to try. I understood that to her a therapist or a counselor was someone who dealt with crazy, or unstable people. But to me, third party help seemed like the only option left on the table, and I've long believed that they aid in processing emotions and expedite the healing process.

After many, many months, finally, she stopped mentioning the problem. Now, I don't know for sure if she was actually over it, or if she merely decided not to bring it up for the sake of our relationship. I chose to trust in the former, and I felt as if a weight disappeared. I wouldn't have this mistake hung over my head anymore, because I truly loved her for who she was. I wouldn't have to worry that my feelings and thoughts fell on deaf ears. We had, through an arduous and taxing journey, overcome what I thought would be the greatest challenge we would face. "If we could get past this, we can get through anything." As clich√© as that sounds, this formed the basis for my commitment and affection for her. My love solidified and expanded, but I should have seen that she was only growing more distant.
