### I wasn't as polite as she wanted me to be.
I think of myself as a polite person; well, maybe a tad bit more than the average person I suppose. I say thank you when someone does something for me, and I offer to help in most most cases. So it's surprising to me when I asked her to help me out with the dishes and she hates that. When I've been to her apartment, not only do I ask to help, I insist on it, and have even cleaned the dishes that I've used. After providing the dishes and utensils at my place for her to use, I thought it'd be natural to ask for help, so that we can finish the job together in a quicker fashion. Don't couples often have one person wash while the other person rinses? I didn't even make her do the harder part, and I took care of all of the scrubbing. I just wanted to get it done so we could get back to what we were doing before. This was something that bothered me a lot. I understand that it's my home and there's things you should do for your guests, but at the same time, she wasn't just any guest, and she didn't come over once in a while. I thought of her as more than a guest. I thought of her as my significant other, someone who ranked right below my parents.



### Her friends didn't like me.

### I wasn't willing to make the sacrifice to do something with her, even if I despised it.

### I was not supportive enough.

### I was too self-centered and had to be right.

### I was too cheap.

### I didn't get past the difficult parts of a game for her.
