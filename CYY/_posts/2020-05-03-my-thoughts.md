Revisiting some of the things that she didn't like about me, I can see clearly that some were justified, and that some not so much. She brought me a lot of pain, but I was more than willing to work through it because I believed in a future where we were together. Now, it seems I was clearly the one who was more in love, and the one more willing to work on our relationship. For the most part, I'd lay aside my pride and look to make things right. I would be the one to make the phone call when texts were not working out, and I would be the one to beg for forgiveness. I was the one who would spend hours on hours trying to comfort her when she'd give up after a few minutes. But I've always known that I was the one who loved her more.

I guess that now that it's over my judgment is a bit less clouded, and it sucks to know that I fought for us more than she did.
