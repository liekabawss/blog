So why does it hurt so much if I know that she wasn't the best for me?

Maybe it's because I noticed how she slowly distanced herself from me. I stopped getting tagged in posts, I stopped getting messages from her about memes, and I stopped getting her laugh. Goodnight texts with love and emojis turned into goodnight texts without saying I love you, and eventually just "gn." I told her it was important to me, and I guess she started doing it again, if just for a little while.

Maybe it's because when she asked for a break in our relationship, she would keep saying that she loved me more, even when it obviously wasn't the case.

Maybe it's because she told me that she might have been crushing on someone else she met at pool hall, a stranger. I tried to be calm and collected as I talked to her about it, but behind the facade, I barely held it together. Those words broke my heart, but I continued to trust that she wouldn't do that to me. Or, if she did, at least she would tell me about it.

That brings me to what hurts the most. She was hanging out at the pool hall much more often and wouldn't reply for hours on end. Deep down, I wanted to believe that nothing was happening. But there was someone I suspected that she was getting a lot closer with. Even so, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, putting my trust and my heart in her hands. After she dumped me, I asked if it was because of someone else, and she told me not to worry about the stranger. But who I was talking about was her friend, not the stranger. Following that, I saw that she was at someone else's place one day. And again, I wanted to believe that she hadn't betrayed my trust. A month later, I called her because I lost myself, and found out that she was already seeing someone new.

I don't know the details of the story, or how it happened. All I know is that it felt like a stab in the back. It felt as if our year together meant nothing to her, and that I was kind of used and not worth grieving over. To make matters worse, she wouldn't tell me who it was, leaving me to speculate, and oh boy, did that fuck with me. If it turns out to be the person I suspect, then it would mean that she possibly emotionally cheated on me and hid that from me. Again, I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt, if not because I want to believe that she's a good person, then because I want to believe that my trust wasn't tossed aside like trash. Assuming that's the truth, how could I bring myself to be so vulnerable to someone else, if the person I trusted the most could break it like that?

Yet, even if I end up finding out that she had done that to me, I can't help myself. I'm still in love with her. The heart wants what it wants, and I feel like a fool.
