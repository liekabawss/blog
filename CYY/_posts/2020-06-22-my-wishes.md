There are many things I wish could've transpired in a different manner, but here are just a few I guess.

I wish that she realized just how much I worked towards being a better person for her. No matter what, whenever something was brought up, I would try to work on it and be someone worth it for her.

I wish that I were better from the start. Then maybe she wouldn't have had been so sad.

I wish she could've been a bit more forgiving. Whenever I made a mistake, I felt as if we would never be able to recover.

I wish she could've understood just how much she meant to me. Of all the people in the world, I would've never traded her for any of them. Even if there are multiple people I could be compatible with, she was unique; I loved her for her. She was my one and only, and I never wanted for anyone else while she was mine.

I wish I could've been a bit more understanding. I'm learning how to be more so now, but obviously it's too late.

Lastly, I wish that I weren't so fucking broken over this. It's been awhile, and it still hurts like a fresh wound. We didn't work out, and I should be moving on, but I feel like I can't.

It's funny, because she never did understand me when I said that I would love her forever even if we broke up. But to me, it's true. There will never be a time when I would refuse her a favor, nor will there ever be a time when I don't care for her.

Fuck my life.
