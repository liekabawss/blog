Hey. Hey you.

Do you remember when we first broke up? I was completely devastated, even back then, and as always, I was the first one to reach out. I couldn't bear to live without you, and it sucks to say that it feels worse now.

Do you remember how we went to Zedd together? That night it felt like no one else in the world existed outside of us, and I fell so, so, SO, deeply in love with you. I kept telling you just how much I loved you, but beneath it all I was very much scared. I was scared that you'd break up with me again. I was scared that you'd crush my heart another time after I handed it over to you. I was scared that you'd be super sad again, which gave me intense heartache. And so I promised you that I'd love you forever, and I said, "We're going to be together forever, right?" You nodded and kissed me back, and I poured my trust into those words. I never was able to shake off that insecurity, and for good reason. I only wanted to make you happy, but my mistake was unforgivable to you.

Do you remember the Christmas card you gave me? I initially thought that you bought it from a store because the quality was so good, but I don't know if I told you that. I hope you didn't hold that against me. It was the one and only letter you've ever written to me, and when I read it, I was so incredibly happy. You said that I taught you what love was, and that you honestly felt as if you loved me more each and every day. You left me a little more than two months after. I'm pretty sure that I told you the same thing before too, but it sucks. I know you probably meant it at that moment, but I meant it for the whole time we dated, and the time we never got.

Do you remember when I fucked up and said that I'd probably be less attracted to you if you got fatter, even if I'd still love you? I thought I was being comforting by saying that I'd still love you, but I know now that being blunt and saying the other part was hurtful. To be completely honest with you, I've never thought that you were ugly in any way. There's never been something about your appearance that I've ever wanted you to change. I know I told you I had things I liked, and things I didn't like, but I never meant that to mean that you had to change yourself as a person for me. I only wanted to share my own thoughts and see if maybe you'd spoil me once in awhile. Whenever you mentioned something about my appearance, I'd make a mental note and do it for you. Not because I wanted to change who I was, but because I knew you'd like it. I thought you were cute no matter what, and I told you so. With makeup, without makeup. Dressed up, dressed down. I loved you for who you were. I just wish you could have believed me.

There's a lot more that I want to say, but I don't want to remember too much
right now.
