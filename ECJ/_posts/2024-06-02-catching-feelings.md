We started talking every single day, and it didn't take long for me to start feeling like she was my best friend. I could tell her all about the minutia in my life, and she could tell me hers. We went on a lot of dates, and each one felt rather intimate, or at least I thought so. I knew deep down that I was going to fall for her, and since I was going to be gone for over a month, I asked if she wanted to be exclusive. She said no, and I'm not going to lie, that really, really sucked. After that, I told her that I would have to end things in a month or two, since I knew for sure that I would be devastated if it went on any longer than that. But honestly, I had known from that point that even a month or two would be too much.

We ended up being exclusive anyways, but not for the reasons that I had hoped for. The week before I was going to leave, she also flew across the country, and we met up at the airport just to be able to see each other, if only for a brief amount of time. That was a really bittersweet moment for me. I knew that she didn't want anything serious, but meeting up like that made me feel a false sense of closeness. It's just difficult for me to see how she could do something like that so easily, but I guess we all have our own definitions and boundaries. Over the next month and a half, we talked every day, and even called at times. For her birthday, I had spent a lot of time making her a gift because I knew that I wouldn't be around, and arranged to get her some flowers that day as well. But it was very apparent that she didn't care nearly as much as I did. There would be a few times when she would make it abundantly clear that she could end things at any time, and I couldn't help but feel hurt. Stubbornly, I forged on.

Each good morning, each good night, and each I miss you was just enough to keep me going, but around January, she told me something that hurt more than anything else had up to that point. We had just spent a lot of time together, and rang the new year in happily. In spite of that, she asked that I act less intimate with her on our upcoming trip with co-workers. Those words affected me more than I thought they would, and I had come to the realization that I had fallen in love with her. I loved spending time with her, and I loved talking to her. And I **_had_** gotten too comfortable, hopelessly thinking that the intimacies we shared, and the fun we had together, might've changed her mind a little.

This was the first time that I told her that I was falling for her, because I didn't want to scare her away by telling her that I loved her already. What would one more month of suffering be? And so I told her that we should break up after Valentine's Day, where we could end it on a high note. She later told me that we shouldn't do Valentine's Day because it was too couply, which was funny to me, because this whole time, we were being very couply (though I can fully admit that I leaned into it more than she did).

I broke things off two weeks before Valentine's Day, and did it fairly unexpectedly. I did want to talk about it more with her, but her mind was set in stone, and if I had tried, I definitely would've completely broken down in front of her, instead of in the Lyft on the way home.

As for why I ended it then, I could tell that things were different, and that she was already planning her exit. She had stopped taking an interest in what I did, and most importantly, she had stopped taking an interest in me. And that killed me on the inside, to the point that it was almost unbearable.
