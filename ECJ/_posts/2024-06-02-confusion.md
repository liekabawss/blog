There's a lot of things that I wish I could know about her, but I don't think I'll ever really get an answer to these questions.

### Intimacy
Every time we looked at each other, I sank deeper into her eyes. Every time she kissed me on the chest, I fell deeper for her. Every time she woke me up to cuddle, I was entangled more with her. And I really wish I understood how two people could do things so intimate, yet have it mean nothing in the end. I fully realize that everyone is different, but I wish I ***understood***.

### Photos
I remember her telling me that she was a little sad that we didn't have too many photos together, but I think that subconsciously, I was trying to avoid them sometimes. To me, they would be memories that would hurt, and it was hard for me to see why she wanted more when we knew that we would be going our separate ways. I did make an effort to take more pictures with her, but I haven't been able to look at them, especially the ones that we took in the photobooth. It's just too painful, but now that I think about it, it's probably a lot easier for her since she doesn't care as much as I do.

### Broken Promise
Before we ended things, I asked her sincerely if she could avoid dating in the office, since it would destroy me to see it. She said that she would, but I soon found out that she had done it. It felt as if the office wasn't a safe space for me anymore, if I were to heal. To be honest, I think that she just forgot about the promise. Yet, that only served to make me feel even worse. Did I really mean so little to you? Didn't you know just how much that would hurt me? Was it really that easy to cast aside the story of us?

You never owed me anything, but I held onto the hope that you would consider my feelings. I thought I knew you better than I did, and I guess that just disappointed me a lot.
