- she's stunning, beautiful, and perfect
- how she copied a few of my quirks after mocking me a little bit
- she's chronically online, and I can share that with her
- the way that she smiles, and how it makes me happy
- she's very passionate about her hobbies
- the way she scrunches up her nose sometimes
- the way she **_HAS_** to be technically correct
- when she's competitive, but tries to hide it
- the way she says "Oh my god" when I make her exasperated
- how stubborn she is but she'll listen to me once in awhile
- how we can compete on the NYT mini and Connections
- how into Harry Potter she is
- the way she's excited over anything Taylor Swift
- the way she's so clumsy, but that just adds to her charm
- how creative she is with her apologies
- how she made notes about things I liked (body suit, voice messages, random things)
- the way she left a smiley face in her agenda when we were going to hang out
- the way she's shy sometimes, but ends up by my side
- how she doesn't like too much PDA, but would hold my arm anyways
- her drive, despite saying that she's lazy and doesn't think she does that much
