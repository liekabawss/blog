I know it was only 4 months overall, with 3 months of dating, but it doesn't change the way that I feel. To you, it's probably nothing and I'm just someone who took things seriously. But it's not easy for me to fall for someone.

There are a few things I regret, but nothing too big.

I wish I talked to you more before ending things. I wish I hugged you longer.

I wish I didn't accidentally push your boundaries a little sometimes. I know that you got annoyed a few times when that happened, and I tried not to do it again.

I wish I wasn't so scared to lose you.

Lastly, I really do wish that you would've just tried things out with me to see how it would've played out. I haven't had a connection like ours in a very long time, and I still feel lucky that you were mine during the short period we were together.
