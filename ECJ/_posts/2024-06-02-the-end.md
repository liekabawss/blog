Remind me to tell you about the Tahoe story that I've been saving just for you. And the message I left you is in your agenda on the calendar pages! (if you haven't seen it already, though I suppose you're never going to see this either)

I told you before that I'm a fairly disciplined person, but not when it comes to you. Looks like that's held pretty true.

It's been 4 months since things have ended, but it's safe to say I'm still not over you.

I still love you Emma.

LMFAO shit's so cringe
