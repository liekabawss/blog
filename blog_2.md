In our time together, she had a multitude of complaints and issues regarding who I am, or was, as a person. I don't mean to say that I was the perfect boyfriend, because I wasn't, plain and simple. But every little thing that bothered her, every little problem that she had, I mostly acknowledged and tried to improve as a person. For her. Some were beyond me, and I couldn't comprehend her emotions and feelings, but I put my best foot forward and made an effort to empathize. So here are some that I remember so vividly that to me, the conversations could have transpired mere seconds prior.

I nagged too much. I would nag about drinking less boba, drinking more water, eating more, and lastly, seeing a dermatologist. This is a topic that's difficult for me to talk about, and even more difficult for me to know how to navigate. On the one hand, I understand that it's quite annoying when someone else tells you how to live your life and constantly reminds you how they feel. Yet, on the other, I felt that as her significant other, I had more of a duty to try to steer her towards better choices. I would nag about boba because quite honestly, it's an unhealthy habit. She started drinking less, but before that even happened, I had long stopped mentioning the idea. She didn't like it when I did bring it up, and so I didn't, out of respect for what she wanted. As for drinking more water and eating more, that also came from the same sentiment. I cared for her so much I didn't want her to be dehydrated and skipping meals. I hated when she would consider a drink a meal, and would try to get her to eat more, or at least tell her to do so. Last but not least, I really, really wanted her to see a dermatologist. There's one night that I'll never forget, and that was when I spent the greater part of two hours comforting and consoling her because it was a particularly dreadful flare up of her eczema. She kept saying that she wanted to die, and wishing that she wasn't the way she was. I didn't know what to do other than to keep holding her close and telling her that everything would be okay. I cried and felt helpless because the person who I loved so dearly was going through an unfathomable amount of pain and frustration. This was the one issue that I never did give up on, because it was the one that I worried about endlessly. Anything that I could to relieve her suffering, I wanted to do. I only wish that she was willing to try to help herself.

I would say, "Look what I'm doing for you" sometimes.

I couldn't let it go when she said "Never mind", or "It's nothing".
