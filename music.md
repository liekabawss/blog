Songs are great, and here are some I listened on repeat haha:

1. Bazzi: [*3:15*](https://open.spotify.com/track/6pmZMP2ET1OJi5rKfLO8jD?si=39lbAApDQ1qydcH8t8eYsQ)
2. PRETTYMUCH: [*Phases*](https://open.spotify.com/track/3je88Q4OvTqIx7BFRFYvRA?si=I6I8qw1hTGOqtF549C4k5w) (we heard this song at U-Cha in Castro Valley, and it reminds me of her a lot)
3. SHAUN: [*Way Back Home*](https://open.spotify.com/track/3NxuezMdSLgt4OwHzBoUhL?si=KTQ3NJNwSaeLdmw-M8_aSw) (she once told me it was the personification of summer, and I consider this song representative of both her and our relationship as a whole)
4. SHAUN: [*Bad Habits*](https://open.spotify.com/track/4QUjn6cprNKiyA8dMTOQ33?si=qibP6f4YS9ajQLoTHVNCXA) (:musical_note: wish I could let you go :musical_note:)
5. Eric Nam: [*Congratulations*](https://open.spotify.com/track/20Mw2qqWcGSCRFmKsa2nad?si=G9e7vBqCTcSwgAHrOlvEVA) (lol simp)
